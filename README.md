- 👋 Hi, I’m @lorselq
- 👀 I’m interested in the Enochian language and AI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about traditional ML/AI and their intersection with newer things like LLMs and agentic teams
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things that combine code and the occult in novel ways
- 📫 How to reach me: lorselq at gmail / @lorslq on discord
- 😄 Pronouns: they/them
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm much better at basically everything than code
